The program takes one line as input. 
The input line contains three integers separated by spaces. 
Let the three integers be I1, I2, and B. 
I1 and I2 are both nonnegative integers up to 100 digits long (there are no leading 0s, except when the value itself is 0). 
B is I1 and I2â€™s base (B is from 2 to 10).
The program outputs the sum of I1 and I2, using the school method, then the product of I1 and I2, using the Karatsuba algorithm.
The results still use base B and seperated by space.

Sample input 1: 101 5 10
Sample output 1: 106 505 20
Sample input 2: 10 111 2
Sample output 2: 1001 1110 0
Sample input 3: 111 10 2
Sample output 2: 1001 1110 11
